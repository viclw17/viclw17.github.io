# GLSL Shaders
This part is very similar to Path Tracing Workshop I've covered.

But the code here are very well refactored and are splitted into multiple files based on their goals. They form a great mind map for the path tracing system I've studied so far.

They are mainly fragment shaders for pixel value calculation. There is only one vertex shader for setting up the rectangle.
