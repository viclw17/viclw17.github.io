# TU Wien notes

### RR

**Monte Carlo is all about picking samples and then compensating**

---

### Improvement

Economize on samples â€“squeeze out whatever we can
- Better sampling strategies (importance sampling)
- Exploiting light source sampling (next-event estimation)
- Combining sampling strategies (multiple importance sampling)

Improving our scene intersection tests
- Build spatial acceleration structures
- Optimized traversal strategies

Support spectacular specular, glossy and transparent materials
