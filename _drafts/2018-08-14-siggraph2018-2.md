# [For Love of Tech Art](https://s2018.siggraph.org/session/?sess=sess301)

## [TECHNICAL ART OF SEA OF THIEVES](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_287&sess=sess301)
We present a dive into a selection of visual techniques and tools developed throughout the production of "Sea of Thieves," ranging from ocean surface rendering and volumetric clouds to Kraken tentacle simulations and dynamic systems of GPU-calculated ropes and pulleys.

## [REINTERPRETING MEMORABLE CHARACTERS IN 'INCREDIBLES 2'](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_303&sess=sess301)
modeling, iteration on 1st movie, adjust on character bodies; adjust on topology to align with the muscles
rigging/face rigging ...
*character, always hard!!!*

# [INTRODUCTION TO DIRECTX RAYTRACING](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensubcur_104&sess=sess268)
This course is an introduction to **Microsoft's DirectX Raytracing** API.
The first half focuses on ray tracing basics and **incremental**, open-source shader tutorials accessible for novices. The second half covers API specifics for developers integrating ray tracing into existing raster-based applications.

## D3D12 basics, TODO: check the sample code, write a renderer
low level api, control memory allocation, obj lifespans, synchronization
- create source in gpu memory(tex, vertices, constant buffers),
- copy data into them,
- record gpu instructions into a cmd list,
- submit cmd list to a queue for exe by HW,
- sync to know when work has finished

parallel execution- creating a resource
cpu
- create buffers
- upload heap
- write date to heap
- copy resource
- exe cmd list

gpu
- exe cmd list
- copy resource
- signal
- call back cpu ...

cpu
- queue - signal(fence)
- fence
- wait
- back from gpu
- destroy heap

binding models
descriptor = pointer to gpu resource
~ table = indexable array of descriptors
~ heap = area of gpu mem with multi ~ list
root signature define binding convention, used by shaders to locate data that need to access

### challenge
acceleration structure format is opaque
ray go everywhere, all geo/shaders have to be ready
different shaders want different resource binding

- build acceleration structures
- memory management(estimate)
- compaction
- animation: rigid body/ skinned animation
- instance masking

config raytracing pipeline
- shader tables, arrays of pointers to shaders
    - shader identifier = 'pointer' to a shader, 32 byte blob
    - hit group = {intersection shader, any hit shader, closest hit shader}
    - shader record = {shader identifier, local root arg}
    - shader table = {shader record A}, {shader record B}
- shader table indexing
- hit group indexing
- compile and link shaders
    - hlsl -> dex.exe -> dxil library

> its all problem-solving practice, under the mutual agreement of world is strictly descriptable AKA science&math. so simple and so clean

# [SCRIPTABLE RENDER PIPELINE FROM SCRATCH](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?sess=sess451&id=gensubcur_135#038;id=gensubcur_135)
Rendering allows you to control many aspects of a scene, how it looks, what tone is conveyed, and how it is stylized. In this course you will learn the basics of the Unity Scriptable Render Pipeline by creating a renderer from scratch. This renderer will include opaque and transparent rendering as well as simple lighting.
