# ADVANCES IN REAL-TIME RENDERING IN GAMES
PC occur the most innovation
close-to metal api, dX12/Vulkan..
new pip, raytracing

## far cry 5
deferred
terrain/water/gi/PB-lighting/values

water
gbuffer water-prepass  
depth w/ water or depth w/o water
differred-lighting water tran postpo

SSLR
SSAO

PB day cycle

## Material ADVANCED
call of duty wwii

## Bokeh, deph of field DOF
Epic, Gillaume, graphic Engineer

problem solving, pixel manipulation, detail-driven for the artifacts
really need to write own renderer with OpenGL, to learn realtime rendering techs
write own raytracer to learn fundamental maths and revise cpp, memory management
great problem-breakdown skill
blurry glass effect? type of bokeh?
really thingk through carrer situation and plan longer
for algorithm study, how about at least go thru all the brute foece solutions first?

...
artifact -> gather sampling density change
hybrid scattering, indirect scattering pass,
scatter occlusion
hole fill

fullres scene color, depth, velocity
prepare
    setup
    TAA
        downsampling -> reduce

-> convolve fg
-> convolve bg
-> gather hole filling
-> brute force gather in focus
recombine
TAA

sub pixel accurate for intersection model
performance

question about postprocessing in vr? psvr?
Bloom & VFX emissive mat?
occlusion? half of frame time on depth test, psvr razorGPU, normal?
GPU profiling general
VR optimization general

## Matt Pharr
Offline/realtime
trace the right ray.
use pr for some, then Denoiser / choose ray wisely
choose random num cleverly
monte carlo AO, hemisphere uniform sampling
monte carlo biased estimator, which preference on direction/area, devide by P(), possibility, cosine weighted hemisphere sampling
this is more efficient and less error, slightly more efficient
7 uniform = 4 cosioe samples
 - Practise sampling with rendering AO! No need for colors.

variance reduce linearly with samle count
variance ratio 1.74
rays needed for equal error 1.75
variance is squared error

choose rays on visible surface! 0.088
reduce variance to  0.03
BVH, reduce more variance, 0.012425

sample warping
uniform sampling -> low discrepancy sampling
2.57X lower variance, faster convergence, 2.5x rays to halve error
stratified sampling 4x8

ray budget
variance-driven sampling

firefly
modern light transport algorithms are not robust
solution: clamping/regularized ray
