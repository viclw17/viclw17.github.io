# [Epic Sessions](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/events/siggraph-2018/learn-from-our-tech-experts)
## Tech behind 'speed of light'
collaboration - Porsche, Nvidia (HW), Epic
area light, RTRT, real time GI, no light map :)

### tools and tech
rtx gpu 2 quadro rtx 6000 in stl
ue4, microsoft dxr

### ref. acquisition
material captures on location
marks on the walls :)
32bit linear workflow
unclamped ibl ?

### data prep
min oh, TA in Epic
inside ue4, no extra modeling
CAD-datasmith-DCC(maya)-ue4, endless iteration
batch process, *python script*
uv
organizing, many parts and quick turn around, ocd, detail-driven
876 cad parts - 165 mesh groups - 9.46m polygons
clean the holes to provide useless ray calculation

### look-dev
matching the materials as realistic as possible
custom material expressions
translucent
cinematic in sequencer
camera work with virtual cam, iphone
photo studio build in BP

### tech about ray tracing
*Unreal broad applications - industrial design, production design, engineering, architecture, vitual capture human, vr, cinematics*
raytracer, soft shadow is big add-on
raster vs raytracing
RT is more suitable for complex effects: GI, refraction, softshadows, dispersion, scattering
RT easier to implement and use
why RT important now? 40ms
how did it happened - hardware + implementation

implementation...
- DXR, DirectX Ray Tracing API, good! easy to prototype, food perf, allow recursiveness
- hybrid tech, use raster for primary visibility (G-Buffer), use RT for complex effects (reflections, soft shadows, area shadow...)
- denoiser, different for each task. state of art, no machine learning yet; critical!(1 spp -> denoiser)
- TAA & noise, challenge, TAA cause white spots noise, but when blur out gonna lose the reflections

## Fortnite - Advancing The Animation Production Pipeline
Looking to improve your understanding of animation production in Unreal Engine? Follow Epicâ€™s Brian Pohl and Ryan Mayeda as they chart the course of new workflow and pipeline improvements to UE4 while dissecting the Fortnite cinematic trailer one year after its initial release.

In this lecture, you'll learn more about what we've improved, changed, and added to UE4 to dramatically streamline your animation pipeline. We'll examine Perforce setup, source control, **python integration**, sequencer improvements, better production management techniques through UE4's Shotgun integration capabilities, and more!

## Mixed Reality Production using Unreal Engine 4.20
LBE location based entertainment ...

# Pathtracing in Production
## Reduce noise
sampling noise denoiser!
