Thanks to the sponsorship of my company Archiact, I was given the opportunity to experience this year Siggraph with a full-conference pass. This 5-day conference was quite an informative and mind-blowing journey. During all types of events I had a great time getting involved with the CG community and learning from the best of the industry. **Here I summarized my journey of Siggraph 2018 and documented all the related resources for future reference.**

# Background
Siggraph is the annual conference on computer graphics (CG) and is widely considered the most prestigious forum for the publication of computer graphics research. It is held in different cities in North America every year and this time it is back to my city, Vancouver.

<!-- At work I am a technical artist working mainly in Unreal Engine. I also used to work in Unity especially on creating customized shaders with Unity ShaderLab.  -->
My current project at work is [Evasion](https://evasionvrgame.com/) which is a [PS4](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/evasion-ps4/)/[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/683000/Evasion/) multiplayer VR game made entirely in Unreal. During the development of Evasion, I've been responsible for the implementation of art assets with Blueprint, creating and optimizing shaders and game VFX (particle systems, shader effects, physics destruction effects) and general GPU profiling and optimization. At spare time, I also have great passion on researching and implementing physically based rendering theories and technologies. So for this time in Siggraph, I focused myself mainly on **game rendering courses, tech art in production, Epic sessions on Unreal Engine and talks about real-time raytracing**.

## Course: Introduction To Vulkan Graphics API
Started my conference on Sunday morning with the course - Introduction To Vulkan Graphics API. Course walked through the whole API from design to code implementation. It was one of the [Khronos-related events](https://www.khronos.org/events/2018-siggraph) at this year Siggraph.

> Vulkan is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern GPUs used in a wide variety of devices from PCs to mobile phones and embedded platforms. This course will be of interest to anyone who writes high-performance interactive graphics programs. [Class Materials](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~mjb/vulkan/).

## Talks: It's a material world
In this [session](https://s2018.siggraph.org/session/?sess=sess287), researchers from the industry presented their latest work on rendering complex materials.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/siggraph-2.JPG" width="480"  style="display:block; margin:auto;">

The first talk [Plausible iris caustics and limbal arc rendering](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_144&sess=sess287) presented by Disney was especially inspiring.

The graphic researcher in Disney took reference of how real human eye responding to various lighting angles, delved into anatomy level of eye to correctly model the eye-light interaction and finally calculated results with real anatomical data. ([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214751/a15-chiang.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214751&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534722028_4a502d08d9333e38985659126dda8e62))

Second talk was [Prelit materials: light transport for live-action elements in production rendering](https://s2018.siggraph.org/presentation/?id=gensub_117&sess=sess287) by Animal Logic.([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214746/a18-agland.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214746&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534734364_2ecd6b3caa23f8e66b92d0f05a0035d9))

## Panel: Design and implementation of modern production renderers
Just out of a fan-boy mindset, I rushed to this panel after previous event just wanted to see all those 6 legendary developers/owners of 5 current industry-leading production renderers: ([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214901/a4-pharr.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214901&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534744633_50f096c3de844b27ae09b57491e5ee89))

## Siggraph Reception
It was a tough day with all those intense advanced rendering courses. Luckily it was wrapped up with an amazing reception event including nice buffet and an insanely huge venue for industry networking:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Social Anxiety MAX ðŸ˜‚ @ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SIGGRAPH2018?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SIGGRAPH2018</a> <a href="https://t.co/oYQa7r3USO">pic.twitter.com/oYQa7r3USO</a></p>&mdash; Victor @ Siggraph (@viclw17) <a href="https://twitter.com/viclw17/status/1029212942862966784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

During the event I was submerged by all the energy brought by the people from all around the world focusing on different fields within computer graphics - gaming, rendering, film-making etc. I bumped into quite a few rendering engineers and technical artists working either in game or film VFX, and had a great time sharing thoughts and experience. One funny moment was in the middle of a conversation with a graphics engineer, I was suddenly told to hold on talking and take a look at an old man that just passed by,

"Did you see that? That's [Jim Blinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Blinn)!" His face was filled with great respect and excitement, "One of the most cool things about Siggraph is, you can always meet some living legend of the industry."

# Day 3
## Talks: For Love of Tech Art
Amazing session focus on technical art in game/film production especially the first one **Technical Art of Sea of Thieves** ([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214820/a46-ang.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214820&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534751899_a55beeb3f72507d39f478bc9d56580ab)) https://s2018.siggraph.org/session/?sess=sess301))

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15F04iBVJxg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"></iframe>

The talk covered few tech art challenges the developers encountered for the game and how they solved the problems with R&D and some creative "tech art tricks". They specifically presented visual technologies and tool developed for
- ocean surface rendering
- dynamic water surface on the boat
- volumetric clouds
- tentacle simulations
- lightning effect
- GPU-calculated ropes and pulleys

Later the second talk from Pixar - Reinterpreting Memorable Characters in Incredibles 2 - walked through their iteration on character design and model/rigs. ([Paper](http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/3220000/3214784/a47-hamou-lhadj.pdf?ip=24.80.119.160&id=3214784&acc=OPEN&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E6D218144511F3437&__acm__=1534752277_d6a56ebe023c79e0ba673ba47054e305))

camera work with virtual cam, iphone
photo studio build in BP

### tech about ray tracing
*Unreal broad applications - industrial design, production design, engineering, architecture, vitual capture human, vr, cinematics*
raytracer, soft shadow is big add-on
raster vs raytracing
RT is more suitable for complex effects: GI, refraction, softshadows, dispersion, scattering
RT easier to implement and use
why RT important now? 40ms
how did it happened - hardware + implementation

implementation...
- DXR, DirectX Ray Tracing API, good! easy to prototype, food perf, allow recursiveness
- hybrid tech, use raster for primary visibility (G-Buffer), use RT for complex effects (reflections, soft shadows, area shadow...)
- denoiser, different for each task. state of art, no machine learning yet; critical!(1 spp -> denoiser)
- TAA & noise, challenge, TAA cause white spots noise, but when blur out gonna lose the reflections
