Hi, my name is Victor Li.

I am a Technical Artist and CG Engineer based in Vancouver, Canada. I develop video games and Virtual Reality (VR) games and applications.

I enjoy creating and optimizing shaders, visual effects and art tools for my project, and working in collaboration with both artists and engineers in my team.
<!-- I also keep the art pipeline clean and efficient in order to maximize performance. -->
<!-- I'm a Technical Artist and Computer Graphics Engineer based in Vancouver with a [Master's degree in Digital Media](http://thecdm.ca/) and a background of computer science. I enjoy interpreting graphics through code and using mathematics and programming as tools to discover how things work and solve problems. -->

<!-- [comment]: I have been always fascinated by the rationality in mathematics and programming, and I enjoy using them as tools to discover how things work and solve problems. I also appreciate the craftmanship and creativity in arts and design, and and I am willing to interpret visual through programming and to bridge the gap between art and technology. -->
