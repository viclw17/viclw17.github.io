I am a [technical artist](http://iamvictorli.com/) and computer graphics engineer
based in Vancouver with a [Master's degree in Digital Media](http://thecdm.ca/).
I am a dedicated team member and a creative problem-solver
with a passion for the game industry and bridging the gap
between art and computer science.
