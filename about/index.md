Hi, my name is Victor Li.

I'm a Technical Artist and Computer Graphics Engineer based in Vancouver with a [Master's degree in Digital Media](http://thecdm.ca/) and a background of computer science. I enjoy interpreting graphics through code and using mathematics and programming as tools to discover how things work and solve problems.

[comment]: I have been always fascinated by the rationality in mathematics and programming, and I enjoy using them as tools to discover how things work and solve problems. I also appreciate the craftmanship and creativity in arts and design, and and I am willing to interpret visual through programming and to bridge the gap between art and technology.

I'm currently working on Virtual Reality games and applications at [Archiact Interactive](http://archiactinteractive.com).
