Welcome to my technical blog! :D

[comment]: My name is [Victor Li]({{ site.url }}/about/) and I am a Technical Artist and CG Engineer based in Vancouver.

_After a few weeks of playing around with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I finally got my blog set up and start to work on my first post now (Yay!). I have been using Wordpress to manage my blog for a while and as almost all the Jekyll related articles mentioned, the experience is just terrible -- I don't need that much of complexity! Anyway, thanks for my college, I got to know [a pretty hacky way of blogging](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html), which is Jekyll + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)._

### Story
Since I graduated and started my internship, I realized my everyday life just changed a lot.
