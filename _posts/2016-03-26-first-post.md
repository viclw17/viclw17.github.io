Welcome to my technical blog! :D

[comment]: My name is [Victor Li]({{ site.url }}/about/) and I am a Technical Artist and CG Engineer based in Vancouver.

_After a few weeks of playing around with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I finally got my blog set up and start to work on my first post now (Yay!). I have been using Wordpress to manage my blog for a while and as almost all the Jekyll related articles mentioned, the experience is just terrible -- I don't need that much of complexity! Anyway, thanks for my colleagues, I got to know [a pretty hacky way of blogging](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html), which is Jekyll + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)._

### Thoughts
Since I graduated and started my internship, I realized my everyday life changed a lot. Although everything switched from study oriented to work oriented and the environment switched from the campus to the office, the real valuable study time actually just started. Everyday at work I got involved in different informative conversations with my experienced colleagues and encountered different problem solving challenges. And, this is just awesome. On the way of solving problems I am able to know how things work under the hood, and being able to know what on earth is happening beneath is such an amazing experience. At that moment all my thoughts are just untwined into clear strings resonating with all the great minds and craftmanship. I may just stand in awe of all of them and then realize it's such a shame not take records of those "ah-ha" moments.

### Stories
My major in university is Digital Media Technology which is a very interdisciplinary major under Computer and Information Technology Department. I learned all the building blocks of computer science - like algorithm and programming as well as various techniques of producing digital media and art contents - like 3D modeling and motion picture editing. Among all the fields I've been exploring around, the Computer Graphics course really shows me an fascinating world with enchanting visuals and intriguing complexity. However, instead of researching, being able to build things by myself is always my goal of study. Also, the great span of my undergraduate study lead to no focusing on any specific area. So I decided to narrow down my skill-set and gain more practical skills from working in the teams, and find the industry I like.

Then I came to Centre for Digital Media and started my graduate student life. As it is a projects focusing Master program, I was provided a lot of great resources and chances to work with people from different backgrounds and learn to be a team player. During the study, game development industry gradually grabbed my interests. Video game is the creative and organic mix of different types of digital media and digital art implemented through programming and graphics interfaces. From then on, I restored and started to keep updating my skill-set as a Technical Artist and CG Engineer in the game industry.

### Blueprint
In my blog, I decide to mainly keep records of all my problem solving experience working in the industry, partly as future reference partly as showcasing. I'm also still learning all the different techniques in practice ranging from game programming to computer graphics, so I will keep summarizing my study process. By working on many side projects with my friends, I have to develop my own tools sometimes from the scratch and the dev log will also be here. 

Ok it's time to play! XD
