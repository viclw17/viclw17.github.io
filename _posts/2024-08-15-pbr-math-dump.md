A post of all mathmatical descriptions for rendering and path tracing theories that I found inspiring. Mainly based on the open courses [Rendering (186.101, 2021S) by TU Wien](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmIqTlJ6KsE2yXzeq02hqCDpOdtj6n6A9&si=0UzTvrBhRnMOKXVr), and with references to *pbrt*.

# Light
## Light integral over the hemisphere
- To sum up all the light, that is an **integral**.
- To sum up from all direction, that is a **hemisphere**

$$L_i(x) = \int_\Omega L_i(x,w)cos(\theta_x)dw$$

- light arriving at point $x$
- light from direction $w$ - **by ray tracing**
- differential solid angle $dw$

> this is irradiance.

## Solid angle
- Projected area on unit sphere. 
- Full solid angle is $4\pi$. 
- Hemisphere has solid angle of $2\pi$

## Differential term conversion
Relationship between a surface patch and the solid angle:

$$dw = \frac{dAcos\theta}{r^2}$$

## Light integral over the surface
Integrate over a single light surface:

$$L_i^{[l]}(x) = \int_{S_l} L_e^{[l]}(y) cos(\theta_x) \frac{cos\theta_y}{r^2} dA_y$$

- light from source $[l]$ arriving at point $x$
- light intensity at position $y$ on the surface

where applied the conversion:

$$\frac{cos\theta_y}{r^2} dA_y = dw$$

- $cos\theta_x$ is reveiver cosine
- $cos\theta_y$ is emitter cosine

## Radiance
Radiance $L$ is flux per unit projected area per unit solid angle:

$$L = \frac{d\Phi}{dA^\perp dw}$$

Radiance is a density over both space and angle.

- Sensors are sensitive to radiance
  - It's what you assign to pixels
  - The fundamental quantity in image synthesis
- radiance stays constant along straight lines*
- All relevant quantities (irradiance, etc.) can be derived from radiance

## BRDF

$$L_e(x,v) = \int_\Omega f_r(x, w \rightarrow v) L_i(x,w) cos(\theta_x) dw$$

- $L_e(x,v)$ is **exitant light** going towards direction $v$ from point $x$
- light going in direction $v$ (the viewing direction)
- materials is modelled by BRDF $f_r$ 

> how much light is reflected from a **given direction** into **another given direction** at a **given position**, and in which wavelengths

- light from direction $w$
- differential solid angle $dw$

## Furnace test
White furnace test, energy conservation

(set $L_i$ to 1 and check $L_e \leq 1$)

... we can derive: $f_r$ of a white diffuse material is $1/\pi$

# Rendering equation

<img src="https://i.redd.it/802mndge03t01.png" style="display:block; margin:auto;" width="600">

Photons are emitted from light sources, reflected by surfaces in the scene until they reach the sensor. In rendering, we (can) go the opposite way. We trace importons until they reach a light source.

## 1. Recursive formulation

### Recap light integral

$$L_e(x,v) = \int_\Omega f_r(x, w \rightarrow v) L_i(x,w) cos(\theta_x) dw$$

Compute the light which is going into direction $v$, integrate over $hemisphere$, check all directions for **incoming light**, **cosine weighting** and **material**

Add light emittance, now we have recursive formulation:

$$L_e(x,v) = E(x,v) + \int_{\Omega} f_r(x,w \rightarrow v) L_i(x,w) cos(\theta_x) dw$$

### Expanding the recursion

$$L(x_1 \rightarrow v) = E(x_1 \rightarrow v) + \int_{\Omega_1} f_r(x_1,w_1 \rightarrow v) L(x_1 \leftarrow w_1) cos(\theta_x) dw_1$$

$$L(x_1 \rightarrow w_2) = E(x_2 \rightarrow w_2) + \int_{\Omega_2} f_r(x_2,w \rightarrow w_2) L(x_2 \leftarrow w) cos(\theta_x) dw$$

$$ where, \;\; L(x_1 \leftarrow w_1) = L(x_1 \rightarrow w_2)$$

Generally:

$$L(x \rightarrow v) = E(x \rightarrow v) + \int_{\Omega} f_r(x,w \rightarrow v) L(x \leftarrow w) cos(\theta_x) dw$$

### 2. Operator formulation

$$L = L_e + TL$$

- T: light transport operator

$$T = KG$$

- K: local scattering operator, $L_o = KL_i$, turn incoming radiance into outgoing radiance, material

- G: propagation operator, $L_i = GL_o$, turn outgoing radiance into incoming radiance, ray-tracing

$$L = (I-T)^{-1} L_e$$

$$S = (I-T)^{-1}$$

- S: solution operator

$$S = (I-T)^{-1} = I + T +T^2+...$$

$$L = E + TE+T^2E+..., |T^k|\leq 1$$

This equation reaches an equilibrium after infinite time / iterations, after which it gives us the solution for the light distribution in the scene.

### 3 Path integral formulation
So the path integral formulation is really just an integral which integrates over all surfaces at the same time

> 16.1 The Path-Space Measurement Equation
In light of the path integral form of the LTE from Equation (14.16), itâ€™s useful to go back and formally describe the quantity that is being estimated when we compute pixel values for an image. Not only does this let us see how to apply the LTE to a wider set of problems than just computing 2D images (e.g., to precomputing scattered radiance distributions at the vertices of a polygonal model), but this process also leads us to a key theoretical mechanism for understanding the bidirectional path tracing and photon mapping algorithms in this chapter.

$$I_j = \int_\Omega f_j(\bar{x}) d_\mu(\bar{x})$$

$$\bar{x} = x_0 x_1...x_k$$

$$d_\mu(\bar{x}) = dA(x_0) dA(x_1) ... dA(x_k)$$

$$f_j(\bar{x}) = L_e(x_0 \rightarrow x_1)G(x_0 \rightarrow x_1)f_s(x_0 \rightarrow x_1 \rightarrow x_2)...W_e^{(j)}(x_{k-1} \rightarrow x_k)$$

$$G(x \leftrightarrow x') = V(x \leftrightarrow x') \frac{|cos(\theta_o)cos(\theta_i')|}{||x-x'||^2}$$

$f_j$ is a product of several factors:
- the light emission $L_e$, which is simply the brightness of the light at position $x_0$ 
- geometry factors between each pair of vertices -- $G$
- the scattering factors $f_s$ for each inner vertex (reflection point), which model the material
- and finally the importance emission from the camera $W_e$.
